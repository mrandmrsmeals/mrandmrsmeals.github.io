Rafute

Ingredients
3
	lbs
	Pork belly, boneless, skin on
	6
	cups
	water
	3
	cups
	katsuobushi(dried bonito flakes)
	1.5
	cups
	awamori(okinawan distilled liquor, substitute with sake or vodka)
	0.75
	cups
	Black sugar(substitute with muscovado sugar)
	1/2
	cup
	Soy sauce (8 tbsp, divided)
	1.5
	knob
	ginger
	



Directions


1. Gather all ingredients.
2. Place pork belly in a large pot (skin side up). Add cold water and bring to boil.
3. Boil for 1 minute and discard the water.
4. Rinse off scum and foam from pork. Rinse pot, put pork belly back in the bot and fill with cold water.
5. Bring pot to a boil and skim off scum and foam. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered for at least 1 to 1.5 hours. Leave the pot uncovered. As water evaporates, add in boiling water enough to keep pork fully covered.
6. Boil 4 cups of water in a separate smaller pot. Once boiling, add 2 cups katsuobushi. Let it simmer for 15 seconds. Turn off heat and let katsuobushi seep in the pot. Set aside.
7. Slice the ginger and cut into julienne strips. Soak them in water for 10-15 minutes to remove some spiciness. Drain well and set aside for garnishing later.
8. After 1 to 1.5 hours of cooking pork belly, transfer the pork to a plate and cover with foil to keep it from drying out. Let it cool until you can touch to slice. 
9. Once the meat is cool enough for you to handle, slice meat into 2.3cm thickness. Add the pork belly slices in a heavy bottomed pot.
10. Strain the katsuobushi dashi into the pot.
11. In the pot, add awamori, block sugar, and 3 tbsp soy sauce. Mix the liquid and make sure the pork belly is covered with the sauce. Bring it to a gentle simmer and skim off any foam. Place lid on pot and cook over medium low heat for 1 hour.
12. After 1 hour has elapsed, add 3 tbsp soy sauce and cook for 30 minutes.
13. After 30 minutes has elapsed add 2 tbsp soy sauce and cook until the pork is very tender and skin/fat is gelatinous, roughly 15 m minutes. Serve the pork belly ona plate and pour some braising liquid. Garnish with ginger slices.
14. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 4 days in refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer.

 Korokke


Image
no_picture_yet.jpg


  

Servings: 6


Ingredients
2
	lb
	Russet potatoes (about 4 potatoes)
	1
	

	onion
	1/2
	

	carrot
	2
	

	Shiitake mushrooms
	2
	Tbsp
	oil
	1
	lb
	Ground beef
	1
	large
	Egg (50g w/o shell)
	1
	tsp
	salt
	1/4
	tsp
	White pepper powder
	0
	

	Black pepper
	1/2
	cup
	All-purpose flour
	3
	large
	eggs
	2
	cups
	panko
	0
	

	Tonkatsu sauce (for serving)
	

Directions
To Make Korokke Patties
1. Peel and cut the potatoes in quarters. In a large pot, put water and potatoes, and bring them to a boil. Cook potatoes until a skewer goes through the potato easily, about 15-20 minutes. Drain.
2. Move the pot back to the stove. On low heat, shake the pot so that the remaining moisture will completely evaporate (but don’t burn them).
3. Turn off the heat and mash the potatoes. Unlike the typical mashed potatoes, you don’t have to mash them completely. I like leaving some small chunks for texture. Set aside.
4. Meanwhile, chop onion, carrot, and mushrooms finely.
5. In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high heat. Sauté onion until soft.
6. Add carrot and shiitake mushrooms and cook until they are soft.
7. Add the meat and break it up with a wooden spoon. When the meat is cooked through, add salt, white pepper, and black pepper. Remove from the heat.
8. Add the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes in the large pot, leaving the cooking liquid behind as we don+t want to introduce too much moisture to the mixture.
9. Add an egg. Mix it all together until everything is well combined.
10. While the mixture is still warm, but not hot, start shaping the mixture into Korokke patties. Cover and let the Korokke patties rest in the fridge for 30 minutes (Do not skip!). TIP: Resting and cooling down the patties prevents the croquettes from exploding while deep frying. The cold patties in the hot oil will not release any steam; therefore, croquettes will not explode in the oil. If you skip this process and the patties are still warm, the temperature of the patties will go up and start to steam, which will then puncture a hole in the panko coating and explode. It also helps the ingredients to meld together.


To Bread the Korokke


After 30 minutes, coat each patty with flour, egg, and panko, in that order.
Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.


To Deep Fry
Deep fry Korokke until they are golden brown. The inside is already cooked, so all you need to do is to fry them until nicely brown.


Transfer Korokke to paper towels and let the oil be absorbed in the paper. Serve immediately with Tonkatsu Sauce.
To Store
You can store the leftover in an airtight container and freeze up to a month. To reheat, put frozen or half defrosted korokke on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper and bake at 350ºF (180ºC) for 15 minutes or until inside is warm.
