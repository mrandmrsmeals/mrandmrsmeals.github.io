Peel and cut the potatoes in quarters. In a large pot, put water and potatoes, and bring them to a boil. Cook potatoes until a skewer goes through the potato easily, about 15-20 minutes. Drain.\n 2. Move the pot back to the stove. On low heat, shake the pot so that the remaining moisture will completely evaporate (but don\u2019t burn them).\n 3. Turn off the heat and mash the potatoes. Unlike the typical mashed potatoes, you don\u2019t have to mash them completely. I like leaving some small chunks for texture. Set aside.\n 4. Meanwhile, chop onion, carrot, and mushrooms finely.\n 5. In a large skillet, heat oil on medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 onion until soft.\n 6. Add carrot and shiitake mushrooms and cook until they are soft.\n 7. Add the meat and break it up with a wooden spoon. When the meat is cooked through, add salt, white pepper, and black pepper. Remove from the heat.\n 8. Add the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes in the large pot, leaving the cooking liquid behind as we don+t want to introduce too much moisture to the mixture.\n 9. Add an egg. Mix it all together until everything is well combined.\n 10. While the mixture is still warm, but not hot, start shaping the mixture into Korokke patties. Cover and let the Korokke patties rest in the fridge for 30 minutes (Do not skip!). TIP: Resting and cooling down the patties prevents the croquettes from exploding while deep frying. The cold patties in the hot oil will not release any steam; therefore, croquettes will not explode in the oil. If you skip this process and the patties are still warm, the temperature of the patties will go up and start to steam, which will then puncture a hole in the panko coating and explode. It also helps the ingredients to meld together.\n To Bread the Korokke\n After 30 minutes, coat each patty with flour, egg, and panko, in that order.\n Cover with plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n To Deep Fry\n Deep fry Korokke until they are golden brown. The inside is already cooked, so all you need to do is to fry them until nicely brown.\n Transfer Korokke to paper towels and let the oil be absorbed in the paper. Serve immediately with Tonkatsu Sauce.\n To Store\n You can store the leftover in an airtight container and freeze up to a month. To reheat, put frozen or half defrosted korokke on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper and bake at 350\u00baF (180\u00baC) for 15 minutes or until inside is warm.\n", "ingredients": ["2 lb Russet potatoes (about 4 potatoes)", "1 onion", "1/2 carrot", "2 Shiitake mushrooms", "2 Tbsp oil", "1 lb Ground beef", "1 large Egg (50g w/o shell)", "1 tsp salt", "1/4 tsp White pepper powder", "0 Black pepper", "1/2 cup All-purpose flour", "3 large eggs", "2 cups panko"]}, "7": {"id": 7, "categories": ["Dinner", "Meats"], "name": "Butter Chicken", "image": "no_picture_yet.jpg", "instructions": "1.
